This is a personal project a "smoked cigarette counter" to practice my react.js skill.

## How does it work?
- The intention is to keep a daily count of cigarettes consumed.
- During the first week the daily rate is calculated.
- One unit is subtracted, this charge is redistributed over the next week.


# iGaret 
also include a cigarette counter in order to gradually quit smoking
